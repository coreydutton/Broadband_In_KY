# Broadband Access Across Kentucky Counties

*Purpose*
Over the past few years and especially during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, many disparities in access to essential services have shown up across Kentucky. Access to healthcare like Covid-19 testing, access to clean water, access to SNAP benefits, to name a few. However, the pandemic has shown just how many Kentuckians also face challenges to online working and learning due to lack of broadband access. Many state and local programs are currently being put in place to increase broadband access across the state - but where are we now? 

This project focuses on access to broadband services across all 120 counties in Kentucky. I pulled data from Broadband Now and Kentucky Demographics to include the population size of each county as well as the percentage of the population with access to broadband. The purpose of this project is to identify unmet broadband needs of Kentuckians and to analyze disparities in broadband access across the Commonwealth.
