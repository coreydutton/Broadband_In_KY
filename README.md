# Broadband Access Across Kentucky Counties

# by Corey Dutton

*Purpose*

Over the past few years and especially during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, many disparities in access to essential services have shown up across Kentucky. Access to healthcare like Covid-19 testing, access to clean water, access to SNAP benefits, to name a few. However, the pandemic has shown just how many Kentuckians also face challenges to online working and learning due to lack of broadband access. Many state and local programs are currently being put in place to increase broadband access across the state - but where are we now? 

This project focuses on access to broadband services across all 120 counties in Kentucky. I pulled data from Broadband Now and Kentucky Demographics to include the population size of each county as well as the percentage of the population with access to broadband. The purpose of this project is to identify unmet broadband needs of Kentuckians and to analyze disparities in broadband access across the Commonwealth. 

*Results* 

Broadband access across the Commonwealth varies, with the lowest rate being only 18% in Hancock County. There are 7 counties in Kentucky where less than 50% of the county has access to broadband. 

As seen in Fig. 1, the lowest amounts of broadband coverage are found when the population of the county is under 100,000 people. 

Fig. 2 zooms in to view the variations of broadband coverage in counties with less than 500,000 people. 

As seen in Fig. 3, the five smallest counties in Kentucky have varying broadband coverage; but only one county out of the five (Owsley) has 100% coverage. 

As seen in Fig. 4, the five largest counties in Kentucky all have high broadband coverage, ranging from 96-100%. Three out of the five counties have 100% coverage. 

While access to broadband varies and many counties in Kentucky do have 100% broadband access, many counties still lag behind. Based on this data, broadband access in Kentucky's 120 counties does increase with population size.
